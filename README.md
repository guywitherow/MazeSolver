# MazeSolver

MazeSolver takes a maze made of ascii characters, and solves it, returning the path as well as a set of cardinal directions to solve it.

## Installation

Use make to compile.

## Usage

MazeSolver uses STD::CIN, so use the syntax "./mazesolver <input_file >output_file", or don't use an output file if you want to see the result in console.
Depending on the size of the maze however, this may lead to the cardinal directions pushing the maze off the screen.
